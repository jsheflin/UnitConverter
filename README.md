A script that runs on the command line, i.e. *Terminal* on macOS, and *Command Prompt* on Windows.

## Description

Simple python script to help science teachers everywhere who don't know how to use Google.
;)

## Testing

To run simple test, command python test.py

## Installation

**Mac OS X**: A version of Python is already installed.  
**Windows**: You will need to install one of the 3.6+ versions available at [python.org](http://www.python.org/getit/).

## Dependencies

None

## General usage information

1. Download the [ZIP package](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/python-scripts/archive/master.zip) and unzip it.
2. The scripts will run by simply typing `python ` followed by the file name of the script, e.g. `python theScript.py`.
 * If the script is in a different directory from which you are trying to run it, you will need to provide the full path to the scriptâ€™s file, e.g. `python /Users/myself/foldername/start.py`.


## Future Tasks

Before asking and listening to the client, I would present:

1. Add a scan/reader function for the actual paper
1. Add ability for the teacher to change or add or remove units
3. track student names or ids and scores
4. gather and present statistics of results
5. Add a GUI
